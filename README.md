# Sales Excellence Dashboard: Category, Customer & Regional Insights

📊 Key Business Insights Summary

This dashboard highlights important trends in sales and profitability across products, customers, and regions. It reveals that categories and sub-categories perform very differently, helping identify both top contributors and underperforming areas. Some customer segments generate high sales but deliver lower profit, pointing to opportunities for better pricing and discount strategies. The analysis shows that heavy discounting often reduces profitability, with certain products consistently causing losses. Time-based trends uncover seasonal patterns and growth periods, while regional and state-level insights reveal uneven performance. Overall, the dashboard helps focus attention on profitable products, high-performing regions, and areas needing strategic improvement
